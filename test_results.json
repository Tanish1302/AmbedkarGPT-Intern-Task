This suggests a more individualistic approach to religion, where each person is responsible for their own actions and their consequences.\n\nTherefore, Ambedkar's view on religion in Document 2 seems to be more focused on the social aspects of religion and its potential role in promoting equality, while in Document 5 his view appears to be more individualistic, emphasizing personal responsibility and self-determination.

          "generated_answer": " In Document 3, Dr. Ambedkar relates political power to social change by stating that the emancipation of the untouchables (a class oppressed within Indian society) is impossible without political power. He suggests that they must organize themselves, educate their children, enter government services, and use political power to protect their interests.\n\nIn Document 6, Ambedkar emphasizes the importance of political power in overthrowing the authority of the shastras (ancient scriptures) which he believes is the root cause of the problem of caste and untouchability. He suggests that social reform is like pruning leaves and branches without attacking the roots, while the real enemy is the belief in the sanctity of the shastras. Therefore, by implication, political power is crucial for challenging and changing these deeply entrenched beliefs and structures.",
